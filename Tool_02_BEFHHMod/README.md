# Tool 2 Bio-economic household model for assessing uptake and impact

This tool is a modular framework at the granular level of households, communities and landscapes for estimating the multidimentional potential uptake domains and the uncertainty of the estimations. based on the uptake we can estimate projected benefits, through avariety of methods.
The modeling framework is based on earlier GAMS modeling approaches that are available in open access and/or not protected by copyright.

Starting point is a repurposing of the bionecdonomic household modeling approach developed by Kruseman in the 1990s and applied in Mali (Kruseman and Bade, 1998; Kuyvenhoven et al, 1998; Kruseman 2000) and Ethiopia (Kruseman 2006; 2007).
